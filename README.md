# GT Drehmaris' Drehmal DLC
This is an unofficial fork of the [Drehmal: Apotheosis 2.2 DLC](https://modrinth.com/modpack/drehmal-apotheosis-2.2-dlc) by tworoundcats.

This fork is based on version 2.2.2 of the DLC released on Sep 21.

Current changes include:
1. Patched the DLC quest system so that non-operator players can interact with quest NPCs.
2. Patched a bug with Pocket Wormholes which caused Pocket Wormhole's cost to be refunded to an arbitrary player instead of the player who had the Pocket Wormhole.
